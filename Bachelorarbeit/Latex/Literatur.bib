The subject of this book is theory, principles and methods used in radar algorithm development with a special focus on automotive radar signal processing. In the automotive industry, autonomous driving is currently a hot topic that leads to numerous applications for both safety and driving comfort. It is estimated that full autonomous driving will be realized in the next twenty to thirty years and one of the enabling technologies is radar sensing. This book presents both detection and tracking topics specifically for automotive radar processing. It provides illustrations, figures and tables for the reader to quickly grasp the concepts and start working on practical solutions. The complete and comprehensive coverage of the topic provides both professionals and newcomers with all the essential methods and tools required to successfully implement and evaluate automotive radar processing algorithms},
